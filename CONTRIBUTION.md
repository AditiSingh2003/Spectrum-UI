## Creating Flutter UI Components

Step 1 : Navigate to [ui-components](https://github.com/Clueless-Community/flutter-ui-components/tree/master/lib/ui_components) folder and Create the file for the component ui.

Step 2 : Create all the examples of the components in separate files.

Step 3 : Create another file in the same folder to include all those components in the single file. This can be achieved using [Lists](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/List-class.html).

[For example: ](https://github.com/Clueless-Community/flutter-ui-components/tree/master/lib/ui_components/alerts) Here the 'alert1', 'alert2', 'alert3', 'alert4' are examples of the [Alert](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/AlertDialog-class.html) widget. 
The [alert.dart](https://github.com/Clueless-Community/flutter-ui-components/blob/master/lib/ui_components/alerts/alert.dart) file consist a List of widget type and includes the examples widgets.

Step 4 : Once you are done with designing ui screen. It's time to create it's card at home screen. Navigate to [widget_category](https://github.com/Clueless-Community/flutter-ui-components/blob/master/lib/data/widget_category.dart). Assign a value to the keys 'categoryName' and 'categoryScreen'.

Here, `categoryName` is the key for the title name of a card and `categoryScreen` is the key for the Screen name of the component you have added.

Step 5 : Test it one more time. `Happy Coding.`

## Updating Flutter UI Components

Step 1 : Navigate to [ui-components](https://github.com/Clueless-Community/flutter-ui-components/tree/master/lib/ui_components) folder. Open the folder named as the component you wanna update.

Step 2 : Add/Update the example of the component in separate files.

Step 3 : Add your added/updated component in the List contained in the screen file.

[For example: ](https://github.com/Clueless-Community/flutter-ui-components/tree/master/lib/ui_components/alerts) Here the 'alert1', 'alert2', 'alert3', 'alert4' are examples of the [Alert](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/AlertDialog-class.html) widget. 
The [alert.dart](https://github.com/Clueless-Community/flutter-ui-components/blob/master/lib/ui_components/alerts/alert.dart) file consist a List of widget type and includes the examples widgets. Actually this file will act as the screen for the component examples.

Step 4 (`Optional`): Once you are done with designing ui screen. It's time to create it's card at home screen. Navigate to [widget_category](https://github.com/Clueless-Community/flutter-ui-components/blob/master/lib/data/widget_category.dart). Assign a value to the keys 'categoryName' and 'categoryScreen'.

Here, `categoryName` is the key for the title name of a card and `categoryScreen` is the key for the Screen name of the component you have added.

Step 5 : Test it one more time. `Happy Coding.`
